His eyes, a piercing blue, seem to hold countless mysteries and wisdom beyond his years. His skin is pale, adding to his ethereal appearance, and a long, dark robe embroidered with arcane symbols drapes elegantly from his shoulders, giving him a regal presence. In one hand, he clutches an ancient staff, while the other frequently reaches to adjust the round spectacles perched on his nose, a testament to his scholarly nature."

- Ensure creativity while maintaining coherence in the description.
